#### A guide for using WSL and all the tools/utilities that will make you a better and more efficient WSL developer.

## Resources

[WSL2 Linux Kernel on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel) is the source for the Linux kernel used in Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2).

[WSLConf](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwFSk464RMxnZkvZ1HKrlNyj-s6Zq4fWe) is a community-initiated event on all things Windows Subsystem for Linux and WSL-related.

## Tools

[wslu](https://github.com/wslutilities/wslu) is a collection of utilities for Windows 10 Linux Subsystem, such as retrieving Windows 10 environment variables or creating your favorite Linux GUI application shortcuts on Windows 10 Desktop.

[Ubuntu on WSL](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WSL) is a wiki guide on getting started with the latest version of Ubuntu installed and setup on WSL for Windows 10.

[Ubuntu Pro for Azure](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/canonical.0001-com-ubuntu-pro-focal?tab=Overview) is a premium image designed by Canonical optimized for production environments running on Azure. It includes security and compliance services, enabled by default, in a form suitable for small to large-scale Linux enterprise operations â€” with no contract needed. 

[Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest) is a set of commands used to create and manage Azure resources. The Azure CLI is available across Azure services and is designed to get you working quickly with Azure, with an emphasis on automation. 

[Visual Studio Code Remote - WSL extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl) lets you use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) as your full-time development environment right from VS Code. You can develop in a Linux-based environment, use Linux-specific toolchains and utilities, and run and debug your Linux-based applications all from the comfort of Windows. The extension runs commands and other extensions directly in WSL so you can edit files located in WSL or the mounted Windows filesystem (for example /mnt/c) without worrying about pathing issues, binary compatibility, or other cross-OS challenges.

[Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) is a new, modern, feature-rich, productive terminal application for command-line users. It includes many of the features most frequently requested by the Windows command-line community including support for tabs, rich text, globalization, configurability, theming & styling, and more.

[PowerShell Core](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, and macOS) automation and configuration tool/framework that works well with your existing tools and is optimized for dealing with structured data (e.g. JSON, CSV, XML, etc.), REST APIs, and object models. It includes a command-line shell, an associated scripting language and a framework for processing cmdlets.

[Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/) creates an  architectural change that gvies a full Linux kernel built by Microsoft, allowing Linux containers to run natively without emulation. With Docker Desktop running on WSL 2, users can leverage Linux workspaces and avoid having to maintain both Linux and Windows build scripts. In addition, WSL 2 provides improvements to file system sharing, boot time, and allows access to some cool new features for Docker Desktop users.

[Dxgkrnl](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/directx-heart-linux/) is a brand-new kernel driver for Linux that exposes the /dev/dxg device to user mode Linux. /dev/dxg exposes a set of IOCTL that closely mimic the native WDDM D3DKMT kernel service layer on Windows. Dxgkrnl inside of the Linux kernel connects over the VM Bus to its big brother on the Windows host and uses this VM bus connection to communicate with the physical GPU.

[Ansible-WSL](https://github.com/Wintus/Ansible-WSL) is an open source program that makes it easier to provision your Windows from inside of WSL by Ansible.

[WSL-DistroLauncher](https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL-DistroLauncher) is a sample/reference launcher app for WSL distro Microsoft Store packages. 

[Pengwin](https://github.com/WhitewaterFoundry/Pengwin) is a Linux distro optimized for WSL based on Debian. 

[Pengwin Enterprise](https://github.com/WhitewaterFoundry/Pengwin-Enterprise) is an enterprise Linux solution for Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) that is compatible with mainstream enterprise Linux distributions.
